This project aims to develop a robust system for early diagnosis of skin diseases using Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning. Given the high prevalence and significant impact of skin diseases in Indonesia and globally, the system is designed to offer an easily accessible solution for early detection, thereby reducing the risk of skin disease conditions becoming more severe.
